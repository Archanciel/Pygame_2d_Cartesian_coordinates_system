# Pygame_2d_Cartesian_coordinates_system
This project creates a 2d Cartesian coordinates system in Pygame. The objective is to offer a base for further development of interactive mathematics.

The project architecture differentiate the computation of the pixel coordinates of the axes components from their drawing by Pygame. This has two advantages:

- Unit testing of computation logic is easier and more efficient.  
- It will be possible to replace Pygame by another interactive app framework.

The target platform are both Windows and Android tablets or smartphones.
